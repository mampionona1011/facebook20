Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter,1
The atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness,1
Not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while,1
Love this place hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor,1
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible,1
Interesting decor,1
What I really like there is the crepe station,1
Also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good,1
you can watch them preparing the delicious food,1
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic,1
That's messed up I'm sorry man,0
Not sure who was more lost   the flat characters or the audience  nearly half of whom walked out,0
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles  the movie disappointed   became even more ridiculous   as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non existent,0
Very little music or anything to speak of,0
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head,1
The rest of the movie lacks art  charm  meaning If it's about emptiness  it works I guess because it's empty,0
Wasted two hours,0
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort  good messages for kids,1
A bit predictable,0
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher,1
And those baby owls were adorable,1
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best  made it look very appealing,1
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious,1
It Was So Cool,1
This is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face,1
It had some average acting from the main person  and it was a low budget as you clearly can see,0
Great case and price,1
Bluetooth range is good a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch,1
Small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place,1
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity,1
I am glad I purchased it,1
No shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch NOTHINGI couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid,1
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better,1
I love the camera it's really pretty good quality,1
Thank you for such great service,1
It's a total package,1
I dislike it,0
This review is long overdue  since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made,1
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay  cinematography  acting  post production  editing  directing  or any other aspect of film making,1
It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces,1
 The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema,1
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute,1
In other words  the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films,1
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this,1
It's quite simply the highest  most superlative form of cinema imaginable,1
Yes  this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle solving  but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture,1
This short film certainly pulls no punches,0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game,0
This is the number one best TH game in the series,1
It deserves strong love,1
It is an insane game,1
There are massive levels  massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game,1
Waste your money on this game,1
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly,1
Actually  the graphics were good at the time,1
Today the graphics are crap,0
As they say in Canada  This is the fun game  aye,1
This game rocks,1
Buy it  play it  enjoy it  love it,1
she dislikes it,0
It's PURE BRILLIANCE,1
This was a flick doomed from its conception,0
The very idea of it was lame   take a minor character from a mediocre PG 13 film  and make a complete non sequel while changing its tone to a PG rated family movie,0
I wasn't the least bit interested,0
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic  but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie and I'm not exaggerating   every moment  every plot point  every joke is told in the trailer,0
But it's just not funny,0
But even the talented Carrell can't save this,0
His co stars don't fare much better  with people like Morgan Freeman  Jonah Hill  and Ed Helms just wasted,0
The story itself is just predictable and lazy,0
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals  and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green screen work I've ever seen,0
But whatever it was that cost them so much  it didn't translate to quality  that's for sure,0
The film succeeds despite  or perhaps because of  an obviously meagre budget,1
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice  as a lesser film certainly would have,1
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written  French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen,1
It's hard not to fall head over heels in love with that girl,1
On the negative  it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen,0
Long  whiny and pointless,0
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts  let this one go,0
Excellent cast  story line  performances,1
Totally believable,1
Anne Heche was utterly convincing,1
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering,1
I sat riveted to the TV screen,1
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10,1
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor,1
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little,1
I was very disappointed in the movie,0
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard,0
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene,0
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters,0
This movie totally grates on my nerves,0
The performances are not improved by improvisation  because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well  but whether the line itself is any good,0
And  quite honestly  often its not very good,0
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another  or fit the surroundings,0
It crackles with an unpredictable  youthful energy   but honestly  i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly,0
There are some generally great things in it,1
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time  though,0
The suspense builders were good  & just cross the line from G to PG,1
I especially liked the non cliche choices with the parents in other movies  I could predict the dialog verbatim  but the writing in this movie made better selections,1
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills  this is a great choice,1
Alexander Nevsky is a great film,1
He is an amazing film artist  one of the most important whoever lived,1
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s    didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of Québec,0
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years,1
If there was ever a movie that needed word of mouth to promote  this is it,1
Overall  the film is interesting and thought provoking,1
Plus  it was well paced and suited its relatively short run time,1
I dislike hypocrisis,0
Give this one a look,1
I gave it a 10,1
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted,1
It is a true classic,1
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B list horror/suspense films go,1
Definitely worth checking out,1
The problem was the script,0
this place is good,1
I was seated immediately,1
Their menu is diverse and reasonably priced,1
Restaurant is always full but never a wait,1
Mom disliked hot dog,0
DELICIOUS,1
This place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area,1
Bacon is hella salty,1
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed,1
The waitresses are very friendly,1
It was horrendous,0
There was NOTHING believable about it at all,0
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were,0
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time,1
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going,1
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip,1
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church,1
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast  some good music including a Shirley Jones rendition of The Way You Look Tonight  and an uplifting ending  give this one a try,1
I don't think you will be disappointed,1
Frankly  after Cotton club and Unfaithful  it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film  because it is BAD,0
The acting was bad  the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere,0
It was too predictable  even for a chick flick,0
Too politically correct,0
Very disappointing,0
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house  because it is beautiful,1
I love Lane  but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy,0
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back,0
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold,1
The acting helps the writing along very well  maybe the idiot savant sister could have been played better  and it is a real joy to watch,1
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good,0
The movie was so boring  that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching  never happened during a Columbo movie before,0
  and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away,0
The directing seems too pretentious,0
Mother fucker,0
The scenes with the oh so mature neighbour girl are a misplace,0
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode,0
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter  who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror  really stupid,0
Some applause should be given to the prelude however,1
I really liked that,1
A great film by a great director,1
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night,1
The music in the film is really nice too,1
I'd advise anyone to go and see it,1
Brilliant,1
Play a song from Mandy Moore's new album thankss,1
well it's a good thing I'm 19,1
WE LOVE OUR TRAFFIC PRINCESS ,1
I'm probably the only person that thinks that's really cool ,1
10 million dollars so when true love comes i can spoil her ,1
Music sounds like an every day kinda kitchen ,1
oh sure that'll be amazing haha just update me with the date,1
You're too kind ,1
wish I could've been there ,0
Sorry Meant to buy some but was flat off my feet all day ,0
that song means so much to me Every time I tell someone though they just focus of the pros,0
something that i don't get to experience frequently ,0
10/10,1
I liked this movie way too much,1
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside,0
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets,1
However  this didn't make up for the fact that overall  this was a tremendously boring movie,0
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film  and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife to be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by,0
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving,0
This was a poor remake of My Best Friends Wedding,0
All in all  a great disappointment,0
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film,0
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing IQ,0
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on,0
The seller is very understanding and patient I would definitely buy from them again,1
Great product for the price,1
I have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use,1
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone,1
All in all I'm quite satisfied with this purchase,1
Great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then I expected,1
Great Product,1
This fixes all the problems,1
I am very happy,1
I've had no trouble accessing the Internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions,1
I saw Mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience,0
Unfortunately  inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict,0
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly  stereotypically and with no depth of imagination,0
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core,0
It is an hour and half waste of time  following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life,0
You can't relate with them  hell you barely can understand them,0
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others,1
This movie is a pure disaster  the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen  it confuses you incredibly,0
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film,0
A truly  truly bad film,0
i just had a bad dream and now i'm afraid to go back to sleep ,0
The acting is terrible  and the writing is worse,0
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder,0
I paid too much,0
Also  it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse,1
It was so BORING,0
No plot whatsoever,0
Again  no plot at all,0
Horrible,0
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas,1
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions,1
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food,1
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated,1
we came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away,1
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay,1
Some highlights Great quality nigiri here,1
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean,1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored,1
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago,1
Worst hour and a half of my lifeOh my gosh,0
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief,0
I hate movies like that,0
Yeah  the movie pretty much sucked,0
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE,0
If you do go see this movie  bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out,0
Awful,0
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much,0
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $750 to see this crap,0
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes  or predictably reverse stereotypes,0
This is a bad film  with bad writing  and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons,0
Crash is a depressing little nothing  that provokes emotion  but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things,0
Still  I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women there's not enough movies out there like this one,1
It does everything the description said it would,1
It works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time,1
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it's not,1
Better than expected,1
Battery is holding up well,1
Linked to my phone without effort,1
THey are so cool,1
What the fuck,0
Easy to use,1
Better Than New,1
A pretty good product,1
Your brain will attempt to shut down as part of a primal impulse of self preservation,0
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover,0
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films,0
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way,0
I mean this in a terrible way,0
This film has no redeeming features,0
Everything is appalling,0
Artless camera work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable  ie,0
The story is beyond stupid,0
The script is was there a script,0
The kids are annoying,0
These are fabulous,1
I'd say that would be the hardest decision Honestly all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing,1
Everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service,1
Now this dish was quite flavourful,1
Seriously flavorful delights folks,1
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas,1
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood,1
Owner's are really great people,1
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful,1
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty,1
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast,1
The lead man is charisma free,0
Utterly without merit on any level  this is akin to torture,0
I'll even say it again  this is torture,0
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity,0
Not a pleasant voyage of self discovery,0
Highly unrecommended,0
If this premise sound stupid  that's because it is,0
Yes  it's that bad,0
Nothing at all to recommend,0
An excellent performance from Ms,1
Garbo  who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era  I wanted to see some of her silent work  but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them,1
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound,1
This movie suffered because of the writing  it needed more suspense,0
There were too many close ups,0
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom,0
But this movie is definitely a below average rent,0
You'll love it,1
This movie is BAD,0
So bad,0
The film is way too long,0
This is definitely one of the bad ones,0
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age,1
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry,1
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him,1
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film,1
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie,0
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self indulgent piece of junk,0
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work  which really isn't that noteworthy,0
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face  a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after,0
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles,1
His performance is simply genius,1
That song's coming up,1
sucks,0
thnks for the info ,1
Go in hell,0
Amazing Would most definitely LOVE to see them again in concert ,1
He owns the film  just as Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughter and Quaid owned Great Balls of Fire,1
 In fact  it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted  and not played by the man himself,1
Ray Charles is legendary,1
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film  which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician,1
Hitchcock is a great director,1
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch,0
Secondly  Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie,1
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films,0
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy,0
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine  desperately depending on the addition of new scenes,0
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws,0
Very windresistant,1
They do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceEasy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried,1
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are,1
Great phone,1
I'm pleased,1
I found the product to be easy to set up and use,1
No ear loop needed it's tiny and the sound is great,1
The handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the Treo rebootsOverall I still rate this device high,1
I'm happy about this purchase good quality and low price,1
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones,1
Mishima is extremely uninteresting,0
This is a chilly  unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture,0
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy,0
And the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to  hairsplitting about purity  the admiration of swords  etc,0
He can bore you to pieces  and kill the momentum of a movie  quicker than anyone else,0
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy  amateurish films,0
When I first watched this movie  in the 80s  I loved it,1
I was totally fascinated by the music  the dancing everything,1
However  I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD  and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was   how it contained holes  inconsistencies and   frankly   a whole lot of crap   and how horrid the dancing was,0
I mean  in a realistic world  she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory The whole thing was quite pathetic,0
The character developments also lacked in depth,0
Woa  talk about awful,0
Do not waste your time,0
you are a loser,0
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly,1
The guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten,1
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night,1
Phenomenal food service and ambiance,1
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time I'm in Vegas,1
excellent,1
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers,1
Delicious NYC bagels good selections of cream cheese real Lox with capers even,1
Great Subway in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations,1
I had a seriously solid breakfast here,1
It was just too horrible,0
The worst  sappiest dialogue I could go on and on,0
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction,0
The poor actors,0
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action,0
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance,0
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick,0
If good intentions made a film great  then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made,1
The film has great actors  a master director  a significant theme  at least a would be significant theme  undertone of fifties existential world weariness  aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination  and characters about which one might deeply care,1
Regrettably  the film fails,0
The movie lacks visual interest  drama  expression of feeling  and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative,0
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie,0
Yet  I enjoy watching it,1
I have headache,0
Unfortunately  this is a bad movie that is just plain bad,0
Bad script  bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad,0
The dialogue sucked,0
The cinematography if it can be called that sucked,0
The soundtrack sucked,0
The acting sucked,0
The concert sequences just sucked,0
That was nice,1
That was funny,1
It was so funny,1
Overall  this movie was cheap trash,0
But this movie is not funny  considering the ridiculousness of it,0
I came out of it feeling angry,0
   SPOILERS    Whatever else can  or can't be said about it  SURFACE is superbly crafted,1
The cinematography is simply stunning  to say the least and the fx are nothing if not state of the art,1
Conceptually  the show offers a little bit of everything  and for just about everybody  parents  kids  fantasy and/or fx fans,1
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting wise  either some surprisingly solid casting  here,1
All things considered  a job very well done,1
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released,1
One of the best mexican movies ever  and one of the less understood  even by mexican themselves  no matter how identified the should have felt with it,1
It ranks highly as a great noir crime drama  incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura,1
The attention given to every character  and complex psychological portrayals  detailing loyalty  treachery  love  and hope  are tremendous,1
It is an excellent drama  an excellent thriller  and an excellent film,1
Up there with the best of Melville,1
Satisfaction guaranted,1
Born to lose,0
RIP Dad,0
Everything about this film is simply incredible,1
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child,1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations  it's an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience,1
The performances are real and gripping  the crocdodile is extremely well done  indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous,1
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series,1
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film,0
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded,0
There is a lot of beautiful places,1
It was forced  like everything in this movie,0
Again  lame,0
Here's where the movie really pi  ed me off,0
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork,0
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick,0
Summary The witticisms weren't witty,0
The plot   well  I said I'd let that one go,0
The acting was bad,0
Really bad,0
Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script  which was worse,0
Camerawork   again  bad,0
Rating 1 out of 10,0
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time,1
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me,1
He is one of my favourite directors  and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema,1
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible  every shot  every scene was like a work of art,1
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen,1
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome,1
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER  i loved the ending  how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster  with Valentine and the young judge together  and the old man watching it on her TV  solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years,1
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film  but a smile on my face  great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy,1
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film  movies  anythingA Work of Art,1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy,1
Rust in piece,0
I literally vomited while watching this film,0
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls,1
his performance  as awarded  was stunning,1
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier  really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop,1
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast,1
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast,1
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5 year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence,0
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry  but delivers a muddled  and often ridiculous story  a bunch of disparate scenes  pretentious dialogue Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap,0
To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful  I can only say   it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt  it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things ,0
One more thing I can tolerate political incorrectness very well  I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief  but the Slavic female character was just too much,0
This is such a fun and funny movie,1
Highly entertaining at all angles,1
It features an outlandish array of memorable  psychotic but lovable nuts,1
So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around  play games  and be dangerous,1
It even has its sweet moments,1
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine,1
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played,1
And I really did find them funny,1
Die die my darling,0
This is actually a very smart movie,1
There is a brilliant twist ending,1
 I love it,1
The ending is so  SO perfect you'll shed a tear,1
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this,1
I will never forget it now,1
It is not just a cult it is a cult CLASSIC,1
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it,0
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue,0
This movie is terrible,0
The hockey scenes are terrible  defensemen playing like they're 5 years old  goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net  etc,0
For those that haven't seen it  don't waste your time,0
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous,0
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters,0
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all,0
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film,0
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce,0
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off,0
Glad I didn't pay to see it,0
Didn't laugh or even smile once,0
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn,0
I hate boredom It sucks,0
It is a really good show to watch,1
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old,1
Barney is definitely super DE duper,1
RIP,0
is pretty funny,1
Babie Bop is very cute,1
The kids are very cool too,1
 But Storm Trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies,0
It's just lame,0
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right,0
Everything about this movie is stupid,0
Even if you love bad movies  do not watch this movie,0
It is shameful,0
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could,1
The writers were smack on and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showThese characters were so real,1
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again,1
Now you know why I gave it a 10,1
I don't know exactly what it is about this movie  but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories,1
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is,1
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch,1
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other,1
Much more interesting  more action  more suspense  and less of the unneeded controversy,1
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid,1
Definitely worth checking out,1
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen,1
This movie has a cutting edge to it,1
I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there   letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him,1
The new characters weren't all that memorable  and I found myself forgetting who was who,0
I got one for my birthday Its awesome,1
Thank God,1
I love mine,1
I have this as well  and I just love it,1
The design is very good,1
Works great  Looks great,1
This is what I use and LOVE IT,1
This is the one I have Love it,1
That's so awesome,1
Thanks for the tip I will be using this one,1
So much easier than the way I was doing it,1
thrilled about being at work this morning,0
Not feeling it today its super nasty and rainy outside,0
Not a cool night,0
Why am I feeling worse,0
every fucking day,0
 friends dying is just horrible,0
They hates,0
Feeling pain,0
RIP Granddad,0
Lost in town,0
RIP to my ipod,0
what the hell,0
Waahhh now I'm getting sad,0
the weather has been really bad,0
Not feeling very well at all today ,0
Merry Xmas,1
my babe is super sick,0
have a headache,0
Having a terrible day,0
It is awesome mines great,1
I hate you forever,0
thanks to all the haters up in my face all day,0
I can't wait to go back,1
It's a great place and I highly recommend it,1
this weekend has sucked so far,0
Very sad about,0
I hate it when any athlete appears to tear on live television,0
Really Dont Like Doing my Room,0
feeling a litle sad,0
not happy,0
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever,0
It didn't make me scared  horrified  or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying,0
The jerky camera movements were also annoying,0
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror,0
There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth  but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot,0
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist  then shed some light on the situation  but it was just stupid,0
If you see it  you should probably just leave it on the shelf,0
I am bored at work,0
Elias Koteas Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets nakedBilly Drago appears in this and is cool as usual  a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget,1
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay,1
I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cuteBut if anyone has a question about Fort Steele  just ask away ,1
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times,0
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing,0
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes,0
God  and I can never get that 90 minutes back,0
I think the most wonderful parts  literally  full of wonder are the excerpts from his works,1
The sets  especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized  beautiful and effective,1
They could be used as exemplars for any set designer,1
The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art,1
After watching this film  I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist,1
I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art  poetry  theater  politics  or Japanese history,1
Here  in The Wind and the Lion  we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age,1
 What makes this story different are the terrific production values   faultless photography  composition and editing   the terrific casting   the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy   and vivid history,1
Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son  every member of the family can identify with one of the characters  whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand  Candace Bergen's feisty heroine  John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy  radiant  ruthless can do lieutenant  Roosevelt's Big Stick,1
This is high adventure at its best,1
I'm completely bored at home,0
I'm very very very bored there's nothing to do,0
I think it was Robert Ryans best film  because he portrayed someone like my father  and he was a schizophrenic in real life  my father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse,1
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt,1
 My mother and brother had to do thisWhen I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man  it was a very good imitation of this type of individual  and I was impressed,1
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old fashioned and not very tuneful,0
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal,0
Unfortunately  'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain,0
Non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well,1
The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful,1
Merry Christmas,1
A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing,1
For people who are first timers in film making  I think they did an excellent job,1
It was very popular when I was in the cinema  a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs,1
It's a feel good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema,1
It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents,1
I rather enjoyed it,1
We have been satisfied,1
I liked it,1
I couldn't take them seriously,0
It really created a unique feeling though,1
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script,1
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today,1
Her role was played well,1
Not too screamy not to masculine but just right,1
I lose my shirt,0
The camera really likes her in this movie,1
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script,1
As a European  the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities  although the circumstances were slightly different,1
I am a fan of his  This movie sucked really bad,0
Even worse than Ticker,0
My daughter loves hers,1
That movie was bad,0
I'm very discouraged ,0
Only like 3 or 4 buildings used  a couple of locations MAYBE  & poor hummh,0
It just blew,0
even more bored ,0
This movie is excellentAngel is beautiful and Scamp is adorableHis little yelps when hes scared and the funniest parts are whenScamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'I totally recommend this movie its coming out on special edition on June 20The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid,1
I just cant explain this movie more than romantic charming hilarious and adorableThe junkyard scenes are funny all the junkyard dogs have something specialToo funny i laughed kids will LOVE itBuy it when it comes out it has new features,1
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda,0
This show is made for Americans   it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere,0
Almost everyone involved must be return to school  acting is utterly predictable and bad  script is pile of garbage all round,0
I wish I could enter negative values  admins,0
The sets are so bad  they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode,0
The use of slow motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting  and bad is a kind word here  no continuity  scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever  vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity,0
Oh yeah  and the storyline was pathetic too,0
I hate writing bad reviews about films   especially those in which I really like the star   but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it,0
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie,0
In short   this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film,0
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell,0
1/10   and only because there is no setting for 0/10,0
An interesting premise  and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut bag  side note I'd love to see Drago  Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones,1
The soundtrack wasn't terrible  either,1
But the acting  even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon  was terrible  the directing worse  perhaps contributory to the former  the dialog chimp like  and the camera work  barely tolerable,0
Still  it was the SETS that got a big 10 on my oy vey scale,1
Yes  I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity  for this really is at the core of the problems with this film   it has too much going on without any real  fulfilling explanation,0
Both do good jobs and are quite amusing,1
But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me  and much of the film was watched with a weird  questioning glance,0
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this   bad idea  we both hated it,0
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well,1
Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous  intoning odd lines,0
The acting was decidely wooden  though no worse than a period Universal B movie,0
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting  so I watched it  twice already  and probably will again,1
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends,1
My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot,1
I won't say any more   I don't like spoilers  so I don't want to be one  but I believe this film is worth your time,1
Wow  what a bad film,0
Not frightening in the least  and barely comprehensible,0
The plot doesn't hang together at all  and the acting is absolutely appalling,0
Not even good for camp value,0
I wasn't expecting Oscar material  but this,0
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming,0
I'm starting to get bored about all the medical shows around there,0
I'm not weird I just get bored,0
This film  and I use that word loosely is an insult to the movie going public,0
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative,0
This gets a 1 out of 10  simply because there's nothing lower,0
This is one I did not have  but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel  and was very disappointed,0
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts  but the acting was as bad as the script,0
Victor McLaglen was even bad  and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable,0
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck  it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them,0
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the President of the US,0
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving,0
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing,0
Whatever the producer was going for  he missed entirely,0
I was deeply impressed with the character he played,1
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor,1
A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation  lots of underbite style stoic emoting  think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo,0
Even the squibs look awful,0
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America,0
The plot  such as it is  is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing,0
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time,0
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was  but not scared at all,0
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense,0
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush  almost always in Olde English  and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words,0
The directing is sloppy at best,0
Hackneyed writing  certainly  but made even worse by the bad directing,0
Of course  the acting is blah,0
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting,0
And  FINALLY  after all that  we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell,0
I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down  but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other,1
I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith  but my god this was one of her best  though it came out 12 years ago,1
This movie contained an all star cast  and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before,1
This movie was kind of long in length  but I enjoyed every minute of it,1
Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1 10 scale,1
Lifetime does not air it enough  so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must have,1
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning  and even less meaning,0
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs,0
Totally different  with loads of understatement and black comedy  this is a film few get to see  but those who do will remember it,1
This movie creates its own universe  and is fascinating in every way,1
But this movie really got to me,1
See it,1
I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies  and that they will continue to do so in their own  some kinda weird style,1
And I forgot The Casting here i superb  with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man  who doesn't understand where he is  what he is doing and why,1
This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006,1
I found this move beautiful  enjoyable  and uplifting,1
Initially the local sites in the film  which was filmed here in Buffalo  intrigued me,1
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film,1
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film,1
I left the theater with a lilt in my step  joy in my heart and hope for the human race,1
Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance,1
The rest of the cast also play well,1
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers,1
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts,0
About half way through this film I started to dislike it,0
By the time the film ended  I not only disliked it  I despised it,0
What this film lacks is a convincing script,0
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed,0
Things happen  characters personalities change  plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it,0
The cast is good,1
For that  it's worth checking out,1
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life,0
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen,0
Everything about it is just bad,0
I could not understand  what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season,0
The script is bad  very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC 17 movie,0
The casting is also horrible  cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors  period,0
Final Word This Show is a real torture,0
It is zillion times away from reality,0
Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show,0
Rating 0/10  Grade Z Note The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show,0
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie,0
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov  who also produced  and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more,0
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical,0
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing,0
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you   the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors,0
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me,0
 very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment,0
 I love talking to you Even if its simple words,1
TODAY WAS A GREAT DAY,1
awesome day soooooooooooooo happy,1
Good morning sunshine,1
is much better now,1
I'm real happy things are good,1
thanks for wishes guys,1
I absolutely HATE,0
Thank you,1
Best thing ever invented,1
Thank God,1
my legs hurt,0
Man I don't feel good,0
it really makes me sad when I look at the reality now,0
is so sad,0
don't feel good,0
life isn't always good right,0
I think my bf is cheating on me,0
happy holidays,1
I'm sick  cough cough,0
my head feels like a bowling ball,0
rain rain go away,0
I hate this family Save me,0
I hate the cold weather,0
there are so many problems i dont know where to start,0
the cast was great,1
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle aged  upper class  uptight white guy,1
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast   everyone played their parts really well,1
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes,0
first of all  there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone,0
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs,0
putting the race card aside  lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifa's character,0
there is no real plot,0
i wouldnt see this movie again for free,0
STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history,1
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse  following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year is probably his most famous film  mostly because it was so ground breaking,1
While you don't yet hear Mickey speak  there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film  something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928,1
However  after seeing the short again after about 25 years  I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is,1
It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing Turkey in the Straw in a highly imaginative  if occasionally cruel way,1
Clever and a real crowd pleaser  this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years,1
The bipolarity of the ruthless thug  one minute a ruthless killer  the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial is completely unconvincing,0
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades  especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there,0
The original Body and Soul  1947 is a masterpiece,1
John Garfield  Ann revere  Lilli Plmer  William Conrad  Canada Leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenJames Wong Howe,1
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake,0
This may be the only bad film he ever made,0
So badwellit's just bad,0
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very  very bad idea all the way,0
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this,0
I thought it was bad,0
Both films are terrible  but to the credit of the 1986 version  it was watchable,0
Let's start with all the problemsthe acting  especially from the lead professor  was very  very bad,0
The script is a big flawed mess,0
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite,0
Director Paul Matthews  who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie Grim  clearly doesn't know how to pace his films,0
The movie is terribly boring in places,0
The lighting is awful,0
The film looks cheap and bland,0
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore,0
This convention never worked well in the past  and certainly doesn't work here,0
The visual effects were AWFUL,0
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake,0
The explosion of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful,0
Okay  I like to consider myself a fair critic  so I'll give credit where credit's due  the creature effects were actually pretty cool,1
Gotta love those close ups of slimy  drooling teeth,1
To sum the film up  Breeders is a terrible  cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus,0
Not recommended,0
did you have nightmares and fell asleep last night ,0
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen  he has little to no charisma  and terrible comedic timing,0
Aside from it's terrible lead  this film has loads of other debits,0
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy  but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence  and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive,0
Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too  as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained  which the PG 13 rating certainly won't allow,0
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill  who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim,1
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent  this remake had little else to offer,0
The budget was evidently very limited,0
This was reflected not only in the cast  but also in the below par script  which borrowed much from the earlier classic,0
However  here there was no decent acting  action or location work to balance things up,0
Filmiing was less expansive,0
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original,0
Generally it just lacked imagination,0
Not recommended,0
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this,0
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place,0
Even when the women finally show up  there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over  you might be far asleep,0
Beware this is not a trashy cult movie  this is trash  period,0
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this,0
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review,0
I great reception all the time,1
I would highly recommend this product,1
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is,1
This BlueAnt Supertooth handsfree phone speaker is AWESOME,1
Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCHr450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs,1
It is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time,1
Blue Ant is easy to use,1
Cheap but hey it works Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item,1
It's very convenient and simple to use gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother,1
The sound quality is excellent as well,1
Being a 90's child  I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons,1
But Tiny Toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular  funny  and underrated cartoons ever created,1
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show,1
Easily  none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way  before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers,1
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character,1
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead,1
Every element of this story was so over the top  excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through,0
Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old  though they are trying oh so  so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really  um  you know  well talk,0
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera,1
AgentBooth That must be some nightmare Glad you got through it together ,1
Nightmare uh that's bad ,0
I remember when my friend forced me to see it with her I had nightmares for weeks ,0
oh dear that's my kinda nightmare ,0
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done,0
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie,0
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles,0
To be honest with you  this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish,0
In conclusion  I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense,0
The story line is just awful,0
It's just painful,0
Rust In piece Steve,0
And the accents are absolutely abysmal,0
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit,0
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non researched film,0
I believe that Pitch Black was done well,1
The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on  and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it,1
Go watch it,1
Omit watching this,0
VERY funny,1
My rating just 3 out of 10,0
The characters are interesting and you really care for them,1
An instant classic  with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits,1
Don't miss it,1
This is a masterful piece of film making  with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian  self indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat   the borderlines between friendship  lust and love  dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns  jealousy  rivalry  cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self sacrifice and more,1
A mature  subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances  apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to  though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it,1
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment  with inventive and elegant use of close up  camera angle and lighting  including pointillistic faux home movie footage  is a wonder and joy to behold,1
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci  but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work,1
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew,0
Regardless  the film fails on most levels,0
Avoid at all costs,0
I saw this film over Christmas  and what a great film it was,1
I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor,1
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic,1
I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor  and I grew up watching his films as a child,1
But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was,1
I'll give this film 10 out of 10,1
What's a good day,1
Sunny Again,1
I must think about positive,1
Feeling strangely fine,1
I love you,1
This girl is the best girl ever seen,1
I love mine,1
Got a Kindle for Xmas and I love it,1
Best thing even seen,1
My Beloved,1
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him  but George was well dull,0
He really didn't seem to want to be hosting his voice overs were monotonous  didn't get involved with the guests,0
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock  with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy  a kidnapped child  a nasty church  a foreign plot and some random taxidermists,1
Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock  the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function  but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white  low budget original,1
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable,1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film,1
Excellently produced by one of Sci fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ,1
But it is entertaining  nonetheless,1
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch,1
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately,0
The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds,0
I have 23 bars on my cell phone when I am home but you cant not hear anything,0
However the riingtones are not the best and neither are the games,0
The plug did not work very well,0
AMAZON SUCKS,0
Rip off Over charge shipping,0
Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive,0
Very disappointing,0
There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts,1
The cast is always entertaining as usual,1
Overall  a delight,1
This movie is so mind bendingly awful  it couldn't have even been created,0
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself,0
The least said about the acting the better,0
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa,1
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process,1
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film,1
The acting is fantastic  the stories are seamlessly woven together  and the dogs are splendid A must rent  view  or see,1
Don't be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10,1
Excellent performance,1
There still are good actors around,1
The warm beer didn't help,0
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time I've stepped foot into this place,0
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER,0
Must have been an off night at this place,0
The service was a bit lacking,0
Also great directing and photography,1
Very true to Shakespear  and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans,1
Macbeth  Jason Connery moved me to tears with his final monolog  out brief candle  outHe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face  which makes it the more interesting,1
Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl  but deadly in her taste for blood and evil,1
If you love death and decay  and Shakespears lyrics this is the one,1
This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book  brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award,1
Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects  which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon,1
However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film about Mishima that is both superb & complex,1
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar,1
Even allowing for poor production values for the time  1971 and the format  some kind of mini series  this is baaaaaad,0
Unless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of Austen's work  you can skip this one,0
If you do watch it  however  there are small consolations The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles,1
It is not good,0
Speaking of the music  it is unbearably predictably and kitchy,0
Then the film just dropped the ball,0
This is a stunning movie,1
Raw and sublimely moving,1
It felt like a very gripping  intelligent stage play  but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences,1
All of the main players are mesmerising,1
Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike,1
Julian Fellowes has triumphed again,1
He's a national treasure,1
GO AND SEE IT,1
This is an excellent film,1
The aerial scenes were well done,1
It was also the right balance of war and love,1
The film gives meaning to the phrase  Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few,1
Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference,1
A good film by a great director,1
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage,1
There are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage  Joe's glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene,0
This is just a great movie,1
10 out of 10 stars,1
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection,0
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason,0
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema,1
Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style  Watkins creates a film like no other,1
This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films,1
It was probably dirt,0
The food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined,0
I advise you to look out for it,1
You wont regret it,1
Highly recommended A,1
Well Just if you keep thinking how bad it is,0
It's a mediocre  miserable  hollow  laughable and predictable piece of garbage,0
It's a case of so bad it is laughable,0
 very bad performance plays Angela Bennett  a computer expert who is at home all the time,0
It is a film about nothing  just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes,0
How awful she is,0
But she is still a bad actress  repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures,0
I think I've killed my laptop,0
The results  well  are a shame,0
DELETE this film from your mind,0
just incredible taste it is hard to believe that Zero contains no sugar but it is totally true,1
How exciting Congratulations,1
had a WONDERFUL day,1
Congrats That is such great news,1
I really like your work is awesome They are so excellent,1
Pretty much in love with,1
Just another day in paradise,1
Gotta love the  commercials,1
I love you daddy,1
good night world,1
makes me smile,1
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste,0
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but I'm not inspired to go back,0
The service here leaves a lot to be desired,0
Am feelin very happy,1
Good morning all Have a great day,1
so much for a good weekend,1
Dream beautiful,1
I am happy,1
good morning lovely,1
I love you so much,1
good morning/afternoon Things will be great today,1
Let's have fun,1
WHAT AN AMAZING NIGHT,1
happy that its sunny,1
One of the worst shows of all time,0
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for,0
The fat computer geek was unbelievable  the bible thumper  the bad ass girl  who are these actors,0
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part,0
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear  you see kids Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show,0
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors,0
Lame would be the best way to describe it,0
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is  in many ways  a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility,1
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character,1
The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye pleasing gem,1
Im big fan of RPG games too  but this movie  its a disgrace to any self respecting RPGer there is,0
The lines  the cuts  the audio  everything is wrong,0
You can find better movies at youtube,0
Top line Don't waste your time and money on this one  its as bad as it comes,0
A Lassie movie which should have been put to sleep FOREVER,0
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time waster of a film,0
So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull  uninteresting mess  this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen,0
It isn't even an achievement as a so bad it's good or so bad it's memorable movie,0
It's an empty  hollow shell of a movie,0
Seriously  it's not worth wasting your  or your kid's time on,0
Its the best headset I have used,1
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that I have found to date,1
Just what I wanted,1
Great product,1
Crisp and Clear,1
The reception has been generally good,1
Excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot,1
Great bluetooth,1
I highly recommend this case,1
WORTHWHILE,1
Avoid  avoid  avoid,0
It will drive you barking mad,0
The transfers are very good,1
Very nice and relaxing late night viewing,1
The movie is full of wonderful dancing  hence the title,1
 some great music  and terrific scenery,1
It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace  and  of course  has  shocking spoiler here,1
 a happy  wonderful  feel good ending,1
The point is the journey  a journey that touches every member of the family,1
It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TVnever mind the fact that I already have it memorized,1
Nothing new there,0
That was done in the second movie,0
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy,0
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted,0
What on earth is Irons doing in this film,0
I just saw this film and I recommend it,1
It has a very good plot  it holds your complete attention  the acting is superb  Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good,1
A very good film indeed  about great and unconditional love,1
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin  but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses  and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering,1
Emily Watson's character is very strong  and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything,1
Despite the pans of reviewers  I liked this movie,1
In fact  I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat  Stuart Townsend better than Cruise's attempt,1
Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha  in places compelling  her first entrance and mini dance scene,1
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style  sensitivities and treatments,1
I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction  he was believable,1
The football scenes at the end were perplexing,0
But I thought his acting was skilled,1
Meredith M was better than all right,1
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart,1
It is rare when a film maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent,1
Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film,1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub genre,1
This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's,1
A standout scene,1
This scene is very strong and unpleasant,0
Technically  the film is well made with impressive camera work  solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill,1
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema,1
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end,1
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son,1
This movie is also revealing,1
Personally  I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue,1
And it was boring,0
I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing  and here they come in thick and fast,0
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up,1
It's a fresh  subtle  and rather sublime effect,1
An Italian reviewer called this a small  great film  and that's right,1
We waited for forty five minutes in vain,0
Crostini that came with the salad was stale,0
Unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE,0
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed,0
For the price this was a great deal,1
Great price too,1
Yes it's shiny on front side and I love it,1
The reception through this headset is excellent,1
2 thumbs up to this seller,1
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight,1
It Works It is Comfortable,1
Battery chargelife is quite long,1
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well,1
Product is exactly as described,1
Avoid at all cost,0
So don't go there if you are looking for good food,0
I've never been treated so bad,0
All the actors give a wonderful performance  especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris  who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star,1
You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie  and a lot about the movie business itself,1
The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating,1
Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard,1
You won't forget this movie,1
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver,0
Food was average at best,0
We won't be going back anytime soon,0
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater,0
Why was this film made,0
The film has an ultra cheap look to it,0
The result is a film that just don't look right,0
None of them are engaging or exciting,0
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it,0
The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time,0
I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973  when it was The Stranger and I loved it,1
But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR,1
This movie is so awesome,1
I loved it  it was really scary,1
I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there,1
If you want a real scare rent this one,1
10/10,1
This is an extraordinary film,1
the train crash in,0
hospitaLs suckk,0
my heart hurts badly,0
Damn I Have A Cold,0
I don't feel good again Wtf,0
disappointed,0
My car keeps crashing,0
Hate Holidays,0
Headaches suck ASS,0
I'm tired of feeling so lonely so easily,0
I don't like this weekend,0
I promise they won't disappoint,1
What a great double cheeseburger,1
Awesome service and food,1
A fantastic neighborhood,1
I hate this job,0
at the doctors,0
in painargh,0
I hate having to work weekend duty,0
baddest day eveer,0
He must be hospitalized for five days,0
A blessed sunday everyone,0
I'm sad about that,0
I don't feel so good,0
What the fuck,0
Today is not a good day,0
As a courtroom drama  it's compelling  as an indictment on the American justice system  it's frightening,1
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process  that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence  but rather  is about who presents better in court,1
The film is well paced  understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen,1
This mostly routine fact based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole,1
Predictable  but not a bad watch,1
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part,1
She carries the movie well,1
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations,1
It is wonderful and inspiring to watch  and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD,1
How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting  the story  the characters  the supposedly special effects  etcit's ALL wrong,0
In fact  this stinker smells like a direct to video release,0
Avoid at ALL costs,0
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series,0
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life  the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain,0
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god  seriously I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards,0
The only place good for this film is in the garbage,0
The worst one of the series,0
Editing The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion,1
When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better  such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk  the song Old Man by Neil Young was played  which evokes many emotions,1
Cinematography The film was shot in an interesting way,1
Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy  but that only enhanced the film,1
This film offers many delights and surprises,1
When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from Don Giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie  you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film,1
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch,1
You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie   but you do wish for just a small sample to savor,1
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression,1
The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop,1
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars,1
Things are not good in my head I may not be around a lot this weekend,0
this is so horrible,0
got a headache,0
Nice ambiance,1
I would recommend saving room for this,1
All of the tapas dishes were delicious,1
I heart this place,1
A good time,1
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi,1
Generous portions and great taste,1
Food was delicious,1
So sad I hate my internet It makes me sad,0
bad day,0
CRY CRY CRY,0
Beautiful girl,1
I hate him,0
Fucking day,0
everythings wrong,0
bad day today Broken glasses rainy weather,0
The acting  as you'd expect from this cast  is top notch,1
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well  particularly Grimes and Blake  and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic,1
Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing  violin playing anatomist Doctor Quinn,1
Conclusion   I loved it,1
we are not happy,0
It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie,1
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it,1
Mark my words  this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20  30  40 years down the line,1
It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949  as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time,1
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand  for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser known cast and for the super intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism,1
Plus  with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time  it does an amazing job,1
Juano Hernandez  an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South,1
Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY,1
See it with your kids if you have a chance  it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years,1
See both films if you can,1
It was that year  however  that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella The Dead,1
Feelings  thoughtsGabriel's discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal,1
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist,0
It's very slow,0
Lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age,0
 Don't waste your time,0
End of Days is one of the worst big budget action movies I've ever seen,0
He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money,0
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen,0
I'm still trying to get over how bad it was,0
I have this as well and I just love it,1
I have this cover and it works great Loud when you open it though,1
I have this one too but its a great cover,1
very nice,1
Works great Looks great,1
have fun without me this year,0
why don't you ever tell ME how amazing I am Let's face it I AM pretty amazing,0
It will probably be the only edition of Rockband where they had to make the riffs on the guitar ,1
everything ok,1
glad you guys made it home safe and sound ,1
they already show it in the cinemas here ,1
I'm with you right up until the temperatures Just thinking about that makes me feel like,0
i miss you too what happened i'll be here for you and i'll see you in 25 days,0
I miss Earl,0
This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever,1
It has everything you could want suspense  drama  comedy  confusing subplots  native americans  brain eating If you're looking for the be all  end all of brainsucking movies  look no further,1
 With great sound effects  and impressive special effects  I can't recommend this movie enough,1
Call me a nut  but I think this is one of the best movies ever,1
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle,1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium  melodrama and horrible acting  a mess of a script  and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING,0
Lots of holes in the script,0
It's like a bad two hour TV movie,0
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong,0
The dialogue is atrocious,0
The acting is beyond abysmal,0
GO TO THE SHOW TONIGHT,1
goodbye exams HELLO HOLIDAYS,1
Same evening him and I are both drastically sick,0
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done,0
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse,0
After waiting an hour and being seated I was not in the greatest of moods,0
I'm not eating here,0
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible,0
LOVE that song,1   
what a great night,1
I love you guys so much that it hurts,1
so happy less than a week,1
SO FAR SO GOOD,1
excellent morning,1
such a beautiful satisfying day for shopping loves it,1
thank God today is friday  I love it,1
I am happy you are staying around here,1
Everything stinks,0
Trouble is  the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable  like character  story  theme and so on,0
Worse  there's an incredibly weak sub plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings,0
It's dumb and pointless  and a complete waste of time,0
In short  don't bother with this movie,0
I won't spoil it  but the ending in pretty amazing,1
The best scene in the movie is at the end  but I won't spoil it,1
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity  then this is it,1
The result is a powerhouse achievement  made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity  and it's distorted interpretations of fame,1
A film not easily forgotten,1
But  Kevin Spacey is an excellent  verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor,1
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years,1
The characters are interesting  even if a bit predictable,1
Highly recommended for all ages  although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references  they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular,1
Great movie,1
Also the story and acting were weak,0
At around 4 pm I bought it  at around 8pm I started to watch  at around 815pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasn't,0
Either way  it sucks,0
The script is horrendously stupid,0
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest,0
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid,0
What the hell kind of crap is that,0
Then  there's the plot holes,0
You could drive a semi truck into these holes,0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film,1
She's poised and amazing,1
Dee Snider just plain sucks,0
he is a killer,0
Feeling happiness,1
He can't act  one of the least scary villains I have ever seen  he can't write  did he write this damn movie in his sleep,0
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing,0
The acting sucks  the music sucks  the script sucks  the pacing sucks  the special FX suck  the directing sucks basically  this movie sucks,0
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably,0
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life,0
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid,0
Avoid at any and all costs,0
At any rate this film stinks  its not funny  and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies,0
Avoid this film at all costs,0
I don't know what happened in Season Five  what a mess,0
Very interesting  ,1
Cool story and a very good idea,1
This is actually a great idea Think of all the rural schools in Africa,1
Love it,1
Young are there gonna be on air contests too havent listened to radio in a while exams ,0
Calm down sweetheartI don't like you upset I gonna cry ,0
he makes me so happy,1
I need 2 stop ,0
LOL We posted the link at the same time Still such a cutie ,1
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed,0
Boy was that sucker dry,0
Over rated,0
i'm hungry,0
Thanks 4 following ,1
Goooood times,1
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict,0
Now this is a movie I really dislike,0
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere,0
The puppets look really cheesy   not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks,0
The story is lame  not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets,0
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible,0
I felt asleep the first time I watched it  so I can recommend it for insomniacs,0
The fact is  this film is a wonderful  heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams,1
Good case Excellent value,1
Great for the jawbone,1
The mic is great,1
If you are Razr owneryou must have this,1
And the sound quality is great,1
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery,1
Very good quality though,1
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone,1
So Far So Good,1
Works great,1
The best part about Nurse Betty is it's unpredictability,1
Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality  and along with the touching drama  and hilarious comedy  you can never tell what is going to happen next,1
Otherwise  don't even waste your time on this,0
This one just fails to create any real suspense,0
As for the killer  don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening,0
There is  however  some pretty good acting  at least  for this type of film,1
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone,0
One of the most boring pointless movies I have ever seen,0
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying,0
Hated it,0
You are not beautiful,0
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad,0
I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store  it's not even a real movie,0
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash,0
I miss New Jersey,0
I never thought I'd become second choice,0
not a cool night,0
RIP Johnny,0
I dislike it,0
Thanks I need all the help i can get,1
I am happy,1
This is not movie making,0
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book  that's how bad it is,0
So I am here to warn you  DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE  it is the dumbest thing you have never seen,0
I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it,1
I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes,1
Excellent short film,1
Hopefully  the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast  or win us over with a whole new film,1
I agree with Jessica  this movie is pretty bad,0
Characters are one dimensional  even the good guys and especially the bad guys,0
The story line is totally predictable,0
Not much dialogue  not much music  the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture,1
I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie,0
Bad characters  bad story and bad acting,0
Really awful,0
Not easy to watch,0
Funny  clever  hip   just like Pray's previous film  Hype,1
It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen,1
Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years,1
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie,1
I rate this movie 9/10,1
The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie,1
Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in At Play In The Fields Of The Lord,1
For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience,1
It never condescends  all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems,1
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen,1
It was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad,0
As for the mains also uninspired,0
If the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worst annoying drunk people,0
Love the margaritas too,1
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint,1
Very good though,1
Great pork sandwich,1
We had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully,1
I LOVED it,1
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here,1
Delicious and I will absolutely be back,1
If it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it,0
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed Not sure if we will go back and try it again,0
Horrible don't waste your time and money,0
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse,0
It wasn't busy either Also the building was FREEZING cold,0
Grandma is very sick not doing well going to the emergency room,0
I just lost a member of my family,0
You cant go wrong with any of the food here,1
You can't beat that,1
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman very friendly kind staff,1
The chefs were friendly and did a good job,1
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding,1
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR,1
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed,1
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza,1
Great Pizza and Salads,1
This place is amazing,1
I'm SICK,0
fuck man I hate this,0
feelin very pessimistic,0
hate u,0
baby died last night,0
Just spicy enough Perfect actually,1
having a bad day,0
I'm sad I hate relationships they suck,0
I don't like it,0
RIP Johnny,0
I hate allergies,0
not good hospital,0
don't deceive your boyfriend,1
so bored,0
hate my lifehate coming home,0
They are so easy to love  but even more easy to identify with,1
This movie is great  especially if you enjoy visual arts,1
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful,1
The story is also both funny and poignant at times,1
People who like European films and art movies will like this movie,1
This is truly an art movie  it actually has a lot of art in it,1
Go rent it,1
However  after finally watching this film  I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts  I also found myself watching it over and over again,1
It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me  simply because it keeps me alert  as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings,1
Brilliance indeed,1
But if you liked movies like The Matrix  and better yet  their sequels I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking  mindblowing experience this film will give you,1
Think of the film being like a dream,1
Simply beautiful,1
Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who   maybe   has written a subversive tract,1
It's a gloriously fun  fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver,1
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives,1
Just whatever you do  avoid Groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic,0
you are a successful woman,1
OMG that's awful I'm sorry,0
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality  for if they did  we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub par mess,0
happy to see him,1
The movie seemed a little slow at first,0
But it picked up speed and got right to the point,1
It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget,1
I enjoyed it,1
This was my first time and I can't wait until the next,1
The bartender was also nice,1
Everything was good and tasty,1
I said that sucks ,0
It was an accident,0
Home Alone and Also Really I'm Sick ,0
I'm afraid that Sony will make me want a PS3,0
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to,1
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon,1
The food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal,1
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing,1
Will go back next trip out,1
Sooooo good,1
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit,1
Nice spicy and tender,1
Good prices,1
Check it out,1
I'm Feeling Better,1
I have recommended it to friends,1
I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz,1
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character  delivering a convincing  sincere performance,1
Their on screen chemistry  critical to the entire film  is genuine,1
The film's dialogue is natural  real to life,1
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food,0
The management is rude,0
He was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas,0
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us,0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service,0
Good service very clean and inexpensive to boot,1
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion,1
Plus it's only 8 bucks,1
Thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time,1
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago,1
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world,1
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me,0
The menu is always changing food quality is going down & service is extremely slow,0
The service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace,0
I give it 2 thumbs down,0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us,0
My wife is still in hospital I was crying so much last night for her,0
The writer  Gorman Bechard  undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character age appropriate,1
The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film,1
Each track commands sentiment  actually contributing to the scenes and characters,1
Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness,1
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film,1
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful,1
My perfect work of art on my hand has smudged,0
If you act in such a film  you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible,0
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998  Deep Impact and Armageddon  and this one fails everywhere,0
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end  by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time,0
Still  it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost,1
Just consider the excellent story  solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses,1
Instead  we got a bore fest about a whiny  spoiled brat babysitting,0
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago  March 20th  2005 and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing,1
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie,1
Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film,1
I keep watching it over and over,1
It's a sad movie  but very good,1
If you have not seen this movie  I definitely recommend it,1
She is as lovely as usual  this cutie,1
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow,1
Recommend with confidence,1
Jealous as fuck ,0
I buy a new house,1
This movie is well balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself,1
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren  Tom Hollander,1
Anyway  the plot flowed smoothly and the male bonding scenes were a hoot,1
The opening sequence of this gem is a classic  and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch,1
Fans of the genre will be in heaven,1
they hurt ,0
i'm still hurting my summer is ruined ,0
shit tell me the story too I had an outta body experience And my hand hurts now ,0
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it,1
I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging,1
Great Pocket PC phone combination,1
I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had,1
This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive,1
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juiceHighy recommended,1
It has kept up very well,1
The case is great and works fine,1
It has a great camera that's 2MP and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality,1
Lange had become a great actress,1
that Air France crashed was awful ,0
Gonna go visit Nick in the hospital soon,0
he must be hospitalized for five days,0
I think my friend is in the hospital,0
The food is very good for your typical bar food,1
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff,1
Point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you won't be disappointed,1
Oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant,1
If you haven't gone here GO NOW,1
Those burgers were amazing,1
Totally unsuccessful trip to the library,0
Hopefully she'll be alright,1
not happy,0
hospital sucks,0
Psychiatric hospital,0
It looked like a wonderful story,1
I never walked out of a movie faster,0
I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off,0
Unfortunately  any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script,0
In a word  it is embarrassing,0
and sadly it did not involve the boss,0
Exceptionally bad,0
All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money,0
Great story  And he has a point,1
Vanilla is really good with fish tacos,1
I have no money,0
I'd like to chat but I can't ,0
Nice headset priced right,1

Steal articles in store,0
sucks when you can help someone and they don't want it,0
wow very cool your English is not bad actually ,1
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasn't that busy,0
It was pretty gross,0
I've had better atmosphere,0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did,0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing,0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine,0
Worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries,0
Host staff were for lack of a better word BITCHES,0
Bland Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing I'll leave it at that,0
I wouldn't return,0
At first I was afraid I was pretrified ,0
Hi I teach some Chinese lessons on youtube Feel free to have a look,1

The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed,0
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement,0

During several different 2 minute calls I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars,0
What a waste of time,0
Its reception is very very poor,0

holy shit ,0
You lost your wallet Shit Hope it's in your friends car,0
they're forced to because of the sponsorship Advertising bullshit,0
you have a shitty night ,0
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love,1
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place,1
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once,1
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service,1
Not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed,0
The fried rice was dry as well,0
don't go here,0
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means,0
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted,0
The pizza selections are good,1
I had strawberry tea which was good,1
Overall a great experience,1
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter Mmmm,1
The chips and sals a here is amazing,1
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot,1
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT,0
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough,0
After two I felt disgusting,0
I consider this theft,0
This location needs a complete overhaul,0
Always a pleasure dealing with him,1
supposed to be happy ,1
This is a GREAT place to eat,1
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good,1
The service was poor and that's being nice,0
Food was good service was good Prices were good,1
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale,0
The chicken dishes are OK the beef is like shoe leather,0
I crashed my Baby yesterday ,0
it's too freaking cold ,0
I am hating this cold weather we're having ,0
Not a coldallergy ,0
But the service was beyond bad,0
I'm so happy to be here,1
Tasted like dirt,0
Best breakfast buffet,1
say bye bye to your tip lady,0
Could not get strong enough signal,0
Bad Quality,0
Basically the service was very bad,0
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger,0
The BT headset was such a disapoinment,0
We'll never go again,0
Will be back again,1
Won't go back,0
Extremely Tasty,1
Food arrived quickly,1
Don't do it,0
happy face,1
But I don't like it,0
Hell no will I go back,0
Clearly my life is a cavalcade of misfortune,0
a perfect weekend,1
all the snow is gone,1
being afraid of food is an eating disorder right,0
and I'm not afraid to fly with the airplane,1
my head is killing meee,0
killed the cat for wishing for the dream job ,0
I killed my dill plant,0
you are satisfying the boss,1
Service was slow and not attentive,0
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me,0
Total brunch fail,0
I probably won't be back to be honest,0
Wow Loved this place,1
I lost my tablet,0
Crust is not good,0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty,0
The fries were great too,1
A great touch,1
Service was very prompt,1
Would not go back,0
Highly recommended,1
Waitress was a little slow in service,0
This place is not worth your time let alone Vegas,0
did not like at all,0
Ah shit ,0
It was not good,0
Very bad Experience,0
I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more,0
Not impressed,0
Bad Choice,0
The pleather case doesn't fit,0
I hope that too  SO good luck with your tests next week,1
I know I felt so sorry for the poor chap  Bad day,0
she is funny and YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH,1
I'm mad as hell Once he sent Danger home the rest of the show sucked ,0
useless phone simply deaf,0
What a mistake,0
the presentation of the food was awful,0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was,0
The atmosphere here is fun,1
Would not recommend to others,0
Service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it,1
I mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible,0
That said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased,1
Not my thing,0
The service was extremely slow,0
Do you really dislike pop rock,0
I don't love you,0
he doesn't love me,0
she didn't love me,0
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it,1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices,1
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho,0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh,0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer,0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced,0
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair,0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only,0
The food amazing,1
I lose my pen,0
Service is also cute,1
I could care less The interior is just beautiful,1
I hate everything,0
Oh man I am so bored ,0
So they performed,1
That's rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good,1
They never brought a salad we asked for,0
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos and friendly staff,1
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed,0
The worst was the salmon sashimi,0
Also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal,1
This was like the final blow,0
The service was terrible food was mediocre,0
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier,1
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere,0
Overall I like this place a lot,1
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive,1
Ample portions and good prices,1
Poor service the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table,0
My first visit to Hiro was a delight,1
Weird vibe from owners,0
Service sucks,0
The shrimp tender and moist,1
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side,0
Thank you for wasting my money,0
They disliked having guests,0
How can that beThe audio quality is poor,0
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device,0
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you,0
Don't buy this product,0
I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear,0
I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side I really abhor it,0
I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected,0
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again,0
On a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service,1
Frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register,0
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section,1
It's too bad the food is so damn generic,0
The burger is good beef cooked just right,1
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse,1
Soggy and not good,0
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious,1
Which are small and not worth the price,0
How awesome is that,1
I will be back many times soon,1
Do not waste your money here,0
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide,1
CONCLUSION Very filling meals,1
They have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food,0
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant,0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom,0
The ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless,0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes,0
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy,0
The service was meh,0
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk,0
I guess I should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the Excalibur but I didn't use my common sense,0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well,0
2 times Very Bad Customer Service ,0
I am bored too ,0
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company,0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up,0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating,0
The turkey and roast beef were bland,0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old,0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying,0
In summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience,0
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN,0
REAL sushi lovers let's be honest Yama is not that good,0
We are so glad we found this place,1
We won't be going back,0
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it,0
This place lacked style,0
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12 ridiculous,0
Nice docking station for home or work,1
This is a beautiful phone,1
Love this product,1
This is a great little item,1
Broke my phone,0
Don't bother coming here,0
The meat was pretty dry I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork,0
The building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but I wouldn't eat here again,0
It was equally awful,0
Probably not in a hurry to go back,0
Always a great time at Dos Gringos,1
This place is disgusting,0
went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing,1
A great way to finish a great,1
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected,1
Really really good rice all the time,1
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well,1
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good,1
This place has it,1
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try,1
All I have to say is the food was amazing,1
Omelets are to die for,1
At least you won't feel that bored for now,1
I wanna chat I'm pretty bored ,1
Everything was fresh and delicious,1
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party,1
On the up side their cafe serves really good food,1
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go,1
The only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming,1
Best Buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it,1
me lookin lika a pic of misery now can't believe that ,0
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious,1
If only you could lick the blood ,0
congratulations  you totally deserved it ,1
The food was terrible,0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED,0
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving,0
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food,0
This is a disgrace,0
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it,0
This one is simply a disappointment,0
Overall I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon,0
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed,0
Left very frustrated,0
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca,0
I gave it 5 stars then and I'm giving it 5 stars now,1
Dessert Panna Cotta was amazing,1
I was crying when Ellie died ,0
That sucks So so sorry ,0
Very good food great atmosphere,1
Enjoy I'll post a streaming version every Monday ,1
No solution that I know of but if I find one I report it ,1
Welcome to facebook And thanks but I don't need a log management solution I work for ,1
Enjoy your wine and take away ,1
Have a great weekend,1
hope you found the solution to my mic problem,0
Damn good steak,1
Prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo,1
The decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant,1
The steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had,1
Good food good service ,1
It was absolutely amazing,1
Many people like joking,1
will definitely be back,1
My gyro was basically lettuce only,0
Terrible service,0
Thoroughly disappointed,0
Works like a charm it work the same as the one I got with the phone,1
Great Value,1
it was a drive to get there,0
Anyway I do not think i will go back there,0
I'm so bloody accident prone ,0
A greasy unhealthy meal,0
first time there and might just be the last,0
They were excellent,1
After one bite I was hooked,1
And it was way to expensive,0
This isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment,1
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group,1
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that,1
This was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious,1
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite,1
Hope you feel better Colds suck Especially in the summer,0
it's shit and rainy and cold Sucks hard ,0
can you believe my cat has a cold He's sneezing all the time,0
they liked to go to cinema,1
Waitress was sweet and funny,1
Cant say enough good things about this place,1
The ambiance was incredible,1
The waitress and manager are so friendly,1
Do Not Buy for D807wrongly advertised for D807,0
I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working,0
Not a good bargain,0
I don't each much pasta but I love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here,1
Give it a try you will be happy you did,1
By far the BEST cheeseburger we have ever had,1
Reasonably priced also,1
Everything was perfect the night we were in,1
We will not be coming back,0
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too,0
Mediocre food,0
I'm super pissd,0
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked,0
Cute quaint simple honest,1
I got food poisoning here at the buffet,0
Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support,0
Buy a different phone but not this,0
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly,0
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds,0
A week later after I activated it it suddenly died,0
CONGRATS my birthdays on wednesday  so is my earth science regents fml say happy birthday  make it better ,1
CONGRATULATION I love you so much you deserve it i can't wait for your new cd Have a nice day ,1
Mic Doesn't work,0
Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying,0
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside,1
The food was great as always compliments to the chef,1
Special thanks to Dylan T for the recommendation on what to order All yummy for my tummy,1
Awesome selection of beer,1
The cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary,0
Absolutely junk,0
THAT one didn't work either,0
Went for lunch service was slow,0
Great product fast shipping,1
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed,0
I was mortified,0
Made very sturdy,1
Needless to say we will never be back here again,0
I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again,0
The commercials are the most misleading,0
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery,0
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me,0
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone,0
Doesn't hold charge,0
This is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible,0
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed,0
it already turn bloody 8 killed and thousands injured ,0
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone,0
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phoneBattery life is short,0
The food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more,0
The chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible,0
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak,0
If you are reading this please don't go there,0
Tonight I had the Elk Filet specialand it sucked,0
he likes computer,1
The phone loads super,1
Worked great,1
Will order from them again,1
bad fit way too big,0
Waste of money,0
Great food and awesome service,1
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didn't expect more tip than that,1
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty,1
As for the service I thought it was good,1
He died in a swimming pool accident in the home ,0
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while,1
My girlfriend's veal was very bad,0
Unfortunately it was not good,0
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom,0
Great for iPOD too,1
This device is great in several situations,1
Great choice,1
Worst Thai ever,0
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron,0
I wear it everyday and it holds up very well,1
Well packaged arrived on time and works as intended,1
The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them,1
This phone works great,1
Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper,1
Spend your money elsewhere,0
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated,0
And the drinks are WEAK people,0
Very good stuff for the price,1
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED,0
Definitely a bargain,1
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase,1
My order was not correct,0
Also I feel like the chips are bought not made in house,0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert,0
We won't be returning,0
Appetite instantly gone,0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back,0
Excellent bluetooth headset,1
It has all the features I want,1
This case seems well made,1
good protection and does not make phone too bulky,1
A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget,1
This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it,1
I love this thing,1
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie,1
I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great,1
I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end,1
Absolutely great,1
She liked swimming,1
Needless to say I wasted my money,0
Unfortunately they removed Ronaldo and Zidane from this club,0

I'm having trouble in submiting my info ,0
I'm just sittng here being a good boy behaving myself Staying out of trouble ,1

I have more trouble with my mom than either of the kids It's because of her that,0
If I had troubles I know who might be the right man to ask for advice ,1
Happy Mother's Day,1
Sorry about kid situation Good luck with the vid Sorry it's giving you so much trouble ,0
Why You went through all that trouble to dye it ,0
Good nights Sweet dreams ,1
I'm exhausted I've been carrying around bloody animals since 6am ,0
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone,1
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall I am very excited to have this source,1
The phone is sturdy and waterproof,1
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price,1
I was violent I miss my girl ,0
he's the one being all violent Why am I getting in trouble  I've not killed him,0
violence is not the answer hands are for helping not hurting ,0
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead,1
I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great,1
Works great,1
The noise shield is incrediable,1
Ohhhh scary horror film,0
Razr Battery Good buy,1
Keep up the good work Amazon,1
I don't like rain,0
What a waste of money and time,0
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad,1
It is very comfortable on the ear,1
It has been a winner for us,1
I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably,1
Iam very pleased with my purchase,1
WORST PHONE EVER,0
Gets the job done,1
Great audio,1
I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but I really like it,1
Poor Talk Time Performance,0
don't drink wine ur gunna get a headache ,0
worthless product,0
I was not impressed by this product,0
I only hear garbage for audio,0
Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery,0
I wear glasses and it fits fine with them,1
great no problems at all,1
Disappointed with battery,0
begins and ends with scenes so terrifying,0
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should,0
Not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it,0
Unreliable I'm giving up,0
THANK YOU! Finally,1
still like it now,1
Avoid this one if you can,0
I wasted my little money with this earpiece,0
left me with a very bad feeling,0
First of all it doesn't wear well,0
I wouldn't recommend buying this product,0
Piece of Junk,0
incredible,1
Poorly contstruct hinge,0
he doesn't like mango,0
